#
# STEP 1 OF THE RAG PIPELINE: LOADING DOCUMENTS
#
# Before we can answer questions about your documents, we first need to READ them.
# This module handles loading different file types (.pdf, .txt, .docx) into a
# common format that LangChain can work with.
#
# What is a LangChain "Document" object?
# ----------------------------------------
# LangChain uses a Document object to represent a piece of text. It has two fields:
#
#   document.page_content  → the actual text string (e.g., "The capital of France is Paris...")
#   document.metadata      → a dict with info about where the text came from
#                            e.g., {"source": "data/sample_docs/report.pdf", "page": 2}
#
# Why use Documents instead of plain strings?
#   Because we want to keep track of WHERE each piece of text came from.
#   When the LLM answers a question, we can tell the user "this answer came from page 3 of report.pdf"
#   — that's only possible if we preserve the metadata through the pipeline.

# LangChain community loaders for different file types.
# These loaders know how to read each format and return a list of Document objects.
from langchain_community.document_loaders import (
    PyPDFLoader,      # Reads PDF files — returns one Document per page
    TextLoader,       # Reads plain .txt files — returns one Document per file

)


def load_documents(data_dir: str) -> list:
    """
    Load all supported documents from a directory.

    Walks through the given directory, finds all .pdf, .txt, and .docx files,
    loads each one using the appropriate loader, and returns a flat list of
    LangChain Document objects.

    Args:
        data_dir (str): Path to the folder containing your documents.
                        e.g., "data/sample_docs"

    Returns:
        list: A list of LangChain Document objects. Each document has:
              - page_content: the text extracted from the file
              - metadata: dict containing at minimum {"source": <file_path>}

    Example:
        documents = load_documents("data/sample_docs")
        print(documents[0].page_content)   # prints raw text
        print(documents[0].metadata)       # prints {"source": "data/sample_docs/report.pdf", "page": 0}
